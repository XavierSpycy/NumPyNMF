# NumPyNMF
NumPyNMF delves into a comprehensive comparison of the robustness of six different Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithms against various noise types. Implemented using the NumPy library, the core aim is to understand the performance of each algorithm when exposed to noise, an essential aspect in real-world data applications.
